Revision log...

v1 - Aug 10 - I created some simple components that display images centered in a div. Not fancy, not complicated. I have been looking for a way to use these components in the standard dom. Not having any luck may need to take a different approach.

V0 - Aug 10 - Just setting up the repo. Nothing to see yet.

Repo created August 2025
